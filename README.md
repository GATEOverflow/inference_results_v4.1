# MLPerf Inference Results v4.1

This repository holds the results of MLPerf inference v4.1

## Visualization of the results

We use `mkdocs` to run a site for better visualization of the results. You can see it [here](https://gateoverflow.github.io/inference_results_v4.1) or you can run it locally by following the below commands.

```
bash docinit.sh 
```
(Use docinit.bat on Windows)

Now the below command should lanuch a local website for visualization.
```
